# jspitfalls

This is a compiled list of potential pitfalls one may across when
using JS. Why are they pitfalls? Well, for me, the expected behavior
isn't intuitive. I hope that by writing them out for myself and 
explaining the aberrant behavior in my own words I will be able to 
avoid them moving forward.
